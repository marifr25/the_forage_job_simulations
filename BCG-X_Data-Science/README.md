# 💼 Data Science - BCG X
## 🧠 Task Overview
PowerCo is a major utility provider that serves small and medium-sized enterprises across a competitive and fast-changing energy market.
With more energy providers offering flexible rates, clean energy alternatives, and digital-first customer experiences, 
PowerCo has been losing customers to their competitors at a higher-than-average rate. </br></br>
The energy market has undergone massive transformation—new players in the market have increased competition, 
new pricing models have given customers more flexibility, and a shift toward renewable energy have forced legacy utility companies to invest in new technologies.
Any one of these factors could be playing a role in PowerCo’s customer churn.</br></br>
PowerCo is losing customers. This customer attrition, or churn, is eating into margins and threatening long-term growth.
PowerCo has brought in a BCG X team to help uncover what’s driving this churn.
## 🎯 Objectives

## 📁 Dataset
### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Historical customer data: Customer data such as usage, sign up date, forecasted usage etc
- Historical pricing data: variable and fixed pricing data at different points in time
### ⚙️ Feature Engineering
- Data that has been cleared
### 🧪 Modeling
- Data from Feature Engineering
## 🛠️ Methodology
### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
At this stage of EDA I do 2 times the analysis on each process, 
The first is in the client data and the second is in the price data.
- Preprocessing & Analyze Data
- Plotting Data
  - Overall Churn vs Non-Churn
  - Churn Rate by every aspect
  - Client Churn Analysis by every aspect
  - Price Range by Energy and Power
### ⚙️ Feature Engineering
- Difference between off-peak prices in December and preceding January
- Encode Multiple Columns
- Creating `customer_lifetime` Feature
- Consumption Features
- Aggregation Features
- Normalisation
### 🧪 Modeling
